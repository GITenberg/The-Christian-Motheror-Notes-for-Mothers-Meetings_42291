iii</span>PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following Notes were prepared
and published some years ago, by one who has since realised in
Heaven the unspeakable value of those precious truths which she
most diligently taught on earth.&nbsp; The little book has been
for a long time out of print, but it appears so calculated to be
useful in the Lord&rsquo;s service that I have thought it well to
publish another edition.&nbsp; It was said of Abel, &lsquo;He
being dead yet speaketh.&rsquo;&nbsp; May the admirable mother by
whom these notes were prepared so speak in these pages to those
who know a mother&rsquo;s care, that they may be assisted to
enjoy the full experience of a mother&rsquo;s joy!</p>

<h2><a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
v</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following notes have been used
by the writer in conducting Mothers&rsquo; Meetings amongst the
poorer classes, and it has been suggested that they may be useful
to other ladies engaged in a similar work.</p>
<p>With this view, she has ventured to publish them in the
present concise form.</p>
<p>It will be seen that they are merely skeletons, and will
require to be filled up by each person who makes use of
them.&nbsp; Thus it will be necessary to <i>turn to the texts
referred to</i>, and to enlarge on each head as familiarly as
possible, illustrating it by simple, and telling facts.</p>
<p>If this is done, and the subjects well studied, it will often
be found, that, although each subject has been generally
compressed into one chapter, it is better to take one, two, or
three heads, as affording sufficient matter for the conversation
<a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vi</span>of a
single evening, rather than too hastily to go over the whole
section.</p>
<p>It will be a cause for thankfulness, if these short notes may
be the means of leading any mothers to search the Scriptures more
diligently with reference to their own especial duties.</p>
<p>Whether rich or poor&mdash;educated or
uneducated&mdash;mothers all need, in the great essentials, the
<i>same</i> help, the <i>same</i> warnings, the <i>same</i>
encouragements.&nbsp; They want to be comforted, both in duty and
trial, by the <i>same</i> word of promise, and to &lsquo;go
boldly to the <i>same</i> throne of grace to obtain mercy, and
find grace to help in time of need.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is earnestly
desired that the study of the following pages, which are, in
fact, only a compilation of Scripture, may be the means of
leading many to listen more closely to <i>His</i> voice, who
knows so well the mother&rsquo;s heart, the mother&rsquo;s sins,
the mother&rsquo;s sorrows, and the mother&rsquo;s need.</p>

IMPORTANCE OF CHILDREN.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Take heed that ye despise not one of these
little ones.&rsquo;&nbsp; Matt. xviii. 10.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I.&nbsp; They are important to <i>Society</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Our future soldiers, sailors, servants,
fathers, mothers, husbands, wives, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; Important to <i>yourselves</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent">The babe&mdash;the child&mdash;the young
man&mdash;the young woman.</p>
<p class="gutindent">A gift (Gen. xxxiii. 5; xlviii. 9) which <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>must prove
either your crown (Prov. xvii. 6; Ps. cxxvii. 3) or your
bitterness.&nbsp; Prov. xvii. 25; Gen. xlii. 38.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; Important to <i>themselves</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent">That child must live for ever.</p>
<p class="gutindent">A living soul committed to your care.</p>
<p class="gutindent">That child must stand before the
judgment-seat of Christ.&nbsp; Rev. xx. 12.</p>
<p>IV.&nbsp; Important in the sight of <i>their Father who is in
heaven</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent">So important&mdash;that for them He gave His
only Son to shed His blood.</p>
<p class="gutindent">So important&mdash;that He especially calls,
&lsquo;Suffer little children,&rsquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; Mark, x.
14.</p>
<p class="gutindent">So important&mdash;that He gives His angels
special charge over them.&nbsp; Matt. xviii. 10.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Take heed then that ye despise not one of
these little ones.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No jewel so precious as the soul of your child, but how far
more do parents often prize the casket containing it, than the
gem itself!</p>

plant so needing watchful care and culture; Oh! neglect it
not!</p>
<p>What have <span class="GutSmall">YOU</span> done with your
jewel, your plant?</p>
<h2>II.&nbsp; THE TEMPER OF THE WIFE, AND MOTHER.</h2>
<p>I.&nbsp; What she should <i>not</i> be.</p>
<p class="gutindent">1.&nbsp; Provoking.&nbsp; Eph. vi. 4.&nbsp;
Prov. xv. 1.&nbsp; Gal. v. 26.</p>
<p class="gutindent">2.&nbsp; Easily provoked.&nbsp; 1 Cor. xiii.
5.&nbsp; Jam. i. 19.</p>
<p class="gutindent">3.&nbsp; Brawling.&nbsp; Prov. xxi. 9; xxv.
24.</p>
<p class="gutindent">4.&nbsp; Contentious.&nbsp; Prov. xix. 13;
xxi. 19; xxvii. 15.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; What she <i>should</i> be.</p>
<p class="gutindent">1.&nbsp; Gentle.&nbsp; 1 Thess. ii. 7.&nbsp;
1 Pet. iii. 4.&nbsp; Children are soon frightened by rough words,
or rough treatment.</p>
<p class="gutindent">2.&nbsp; Forbearing.&nbsp; Eph. iv. 2.&nbsp;
Col. iii. 13.&nbsp; If <i>you</i> cannot bear with your children,
who will?</p>
<p class="gutindent"><a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>3.&nbsp; Patient.&nbsp; 1 Thess. v.
14.&nbsp; Eccles. vii. 8.&nbsp; A mother has need of great
patience.</p>
<p class="gutindent">4.&nbsp; Loving.&nbsp; Tit. ii. 4.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; In your daily temper take Christ as your
example.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<i>Consider Him</i> who endured such
contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be weary, and
faint in your minds.&rsquo;&nbsp; Heb. xii. 3.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>III.&nbsp; TRUTH.&nbsp; 1.</h2>
<p>Importance of truth.&nbsp; Prov. xii. 19.</p>
<p>The liar&rsquo;s portion.&nbsp; Rev. xxi. 8; xxii. 15.</p>
<p>How can you enforce the necessity of truth, and the sin of
lying upon your children?</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; You must enforce it by <i>example</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent">1.&nbsp; Never deceive them.&nbsp; The word
passed must never be broken.&nbsp; Be careful, then, how you
promise or threaten.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>2.&nbsp; Always adhere yourself
closely to truth.&nbsp; In <i>little</i> things as well as
<i>great</i>, in <i>deed</i> as well as <i>word</i>.&nbsp; What a
warning is Rebecca (Gen. xxvii.) of the danger of the first
downward step, and the baneful influence of a mother&rsquo;s evil
example!</p>
<p class="gutindent">3.&nbsp; Let them see that you cling closely
to truth, even when it is to your own disadvantage.&nbsp; Ps. xv.
5, Prayer-book version.</p>
<p class="gutindent">4.&nbsp; Never get out of a difficulty by an
untruth.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; To do this be ever&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent">Watchful.&nbsp; Ps. cxli. 3.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Prayerful.&nbsp; Ps. cxix. 29.</p>
<h2>IV.&nbsp; TRUTH.&nbsp; 2.</h2>
<p>Last meeting we found that it is useless to enforce the
necessity of truth, unless the <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>mother is consistent in her
<i>example</i>.&nbsp; Besides this:</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; Enforce it by instruction and by precept.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Tell&mdash;how God hates lying.&nbsp; Prov.
vi. 16, 17; xii. 22.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Tell&mdash;histories from Scripture to show
how God hates it.&nbsp; Satan, Gen. iii. 4.&nbsp; Gehazi, 2
Kings, v. 25.&nbsp; Ananias, Acts, v. 1&ndash;11.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Tell&mdash;who is the father of lies.&nbsp;
John, viii. 44.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Tell&mdash;the consequences of lying.&nbsp;
Ps. v. 6; lv. 23.&nbsp; Rev. xxi. 8.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; Avoid severity.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Children are often frightened into deceit by
fear of their parents&rsquo; severity.</p>
<p>IV.&nbsp; Do not put temptations to lie in a child&rsquo;s
way.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Do not encourage them to conceal anything
from their father, schoolmaster, master, or mistress, if in
service.</p>
<p>V.&nbsp; Correct for a lie.</p>
<p class="gutindent">It is a false love which dispenses with a <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>needful
chastisement.&nbsp; Prov. xiii. 24; xix. 18.</p>
<p class="gutindent">But always with prayer.</p>
<p>VI.&nbsp; Let the child see that you are grieved for his
sin.&nbsp; That it gives you <i>sorrow</i>, not only causes
<i>anger</i>.&nbsp; Ps. cxix. 158.</p>
<p>VII.&nbsp; Make it a subject of prayer with your child that
the way of lying may be removed from him.&nbsp; Ps. cxix.
29.&nbsp; Prov. xxx. 8.</p>
<h2>V.&nbsp; THE EXCELLENT WOMAN.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">Prov. xxxi.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">As a
Wife</span>.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; A wife <i>ought</i> to be a chief blessing; a good

xix. 14.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; Her husband can safely trust her.&nbsp; Ver. 11.</p>

<p class="gutindent">To do this must be a &lsquo;keeper at

<p>V.&nbsp; She submits if wills clash.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Not often the case in a happy home.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Yields cheerfully, not grudgingly, when in
accordance with God&rsquo;s will.&nbsp; Col. iii. 18.&nbsp; Eph.

<h2>XXIII.&nbsp; HELPS FOR MOTHERS.<br />
1.</h2>
<p>A mother has many hindrances in seeking Christ.&nbsp; She
needs much help from the means of grace.&nbsp; To obtain this is
often difficult, and requires much effort.&nbsp; Outward means
are, therefore, too often neglected.&nbsp; If you would grow in
grace this must not be.</p>
<p>Be diligent, therefore, in the use of&mdash;</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; Daily prayer.&nbsp; Matt. vi. 6, 11.</p>
<p class="gutindent">No business should prevent this.&nbsp; David
had the business of a kingdom upon him, nevertheless, he says,
&lsquo;Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I
pray.&rsquo;&nbsp; Ps. lv. 17.</p>
<p><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p>III.&nbsp; Family prayer.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Judgment pronounced on those who neglect
family religion.&nbsp; Jer. x. 25.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Promise to united prayer.&nbsp; Matt. xviii.
19, 20.</p>
<p>IV.&nbsp; Attendance on the public means of grace.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Observe the command.&nbsp; Deut. xii. 12,
18.&nbsp; Heb. x. 25.</p>
<p class="gutindent">What a blessing rested on it in the case of
Lydia.&nbsp; Acts, xvi. 13, 15.</p>
<p class="gutindent">There are great difficulties to the mother
of a young family in going to Church on Sunday, but make an
effort to overcome them.&nbsp; This can generally be done if
husband and wife make a <i>united effort</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent">If you are truly hungering and thirsting
after righteousness, you will earnestly use every means for
obtaining the bread and the water of life.&nbsp; If you are
careless in this respect, it is because there is no real hunger,
no craving of soul for heavenly food.</p>

48</span>XXIV.&nbsp; HELPS FOR MOTHERS.<br />
2.</h2>
<p>We will notice this evening three more things which are, or
ought to be, &lsquo;helps&rsquo; to mothers on the heavenly
race.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; Husbands and wives should be <i>mutual</i> helps,
(see Marriage Service) &lsquo;for the mutual help and comfort the
one of the other.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="gutindent">Gen. ii. 18.&nbsp; 1 Pet. iii. 7.&nbsp; Eph.
v. 28, 29.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Fellow-pilgrims, fellow-sufferers,
fellow-travellers they <i>must be</i>; but what an unspeakable
joy is it when they are also fellow-helpers, fellow-labourers,
fellow-heirs, fellow-citizens!</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;O happy house, where man and wife are
one,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thro&rsquo; love of Thee, in spirit, heart, and
mind;<br />
Together joined by holy bands, which none,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not death itself, can sever or unbind;<br />
Where both on thee unfailingly depend,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In weal and woe, in good and evil days,<br />
And hope with Thee eternity to spend;<br />

<p class="gutindent">What comfort and <i>help</i> may be derived

a kind and devoted district visitor, or minister.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Especially may Christian friends help each
other by <i>prayer</i>.&nbsp; 2 Cor. i. 11.&nbsp; Jam. v. 16,
18.&nbsp; Matt. xviii. 19.</p>
<p class="gutindent">How valuable is a Prayer Union, such as we
have connected with our Mothers&rsquo; Meeting.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; But lastly remember that these &lsquo;helps&rsquo;
are worth nothing unless you have <i>the Lord for your
Helper</i>.&nbsp; Ps. liv. 4.&nbsp; Heb. xiii. 6.&nbsp; Exod.
xviii. 4.</p>
<p class="gutindent">He is different to any earthly helper, for
He is a Helper at all times, and in all circumstances.</p>

<p class="gutindent">To the widow.&nbsp; Ps. lxviii. 5.</p>
<p class="gutindent">To the fatherless.&nbsp; Ps. x. 14.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Take, therefore, this short prayer and use
it in your daily life, &lsquo;Lord, be <i>Thou</i> my
helper.&rsquo;&nbsp; Lift up this prayer in the midst of your
work&mdash;of temptation&mdash;<a name="page50"></a><span

add, &lsquo;My heart trusted in Him, and <i>I am
helped</i>!&rsquo;&nbsp; Ps. xxviii. 7.</p>
<h2>XXV.&nbsp; TEACH YOUR CHILDREN.</h2>
<p>A mother may not have much time for instruction, or be very
capable of teaching, but she should make it her daily duty to
give her children some instruction in the Scriptures.&nbsp; She
may know but little herself, but let not this discourage her; for
in watering others she shall herself be watered.&nbsp; Prov. xi.
25.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; Teach, seeking the help of the Holy Spirit.&nbsp;

<h2>XXVI.&nbsp; THE PARTING PLACE, AND THE MEETING PLACE.</h2>
<p>The following circumstance took place not long after the last
meeting.&nbsp; Two mothers, who were both present at the Class,
about a fortnight after met in the Cemetery, sorrowing at their
children&rsquo;s graves.&nbsp; Each had during that interval lost
a child, but not having heard of each other&rsquo;s trouble, the
meeting was unexpected.</p>
<p>On this occasion the following subject was taken.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; The parting place&mdash;the child&rsquo;s
death-bed.&nbsp; This is,</p>
<p class="gutindent">1.&nbsp; A parting place.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>All must die alone.&nbsp; The mother
may have watched over her child with untiring care during its
years of infancy, the trials of youth, and the snares and cares
of riper years, but here they <i>must part</i>.&nbsp; 2 Sam. xii.

<p class="gutindent">To a new and heavenly life.&nbsp; But not so
to <i>all</i>.&nbsp; To <i>some</i>, namely, to those who have
indeed been born again.&nbsp; Luke, xvi. 22; and to babes.&nbsp;
Isa. xl. 11.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Contrast David&rsquo;s sorrow for his
infant, (2 Sam. xii. 23) with his sorrow for Absalom, 2 Sam. xix.

of <i>death</i>.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; The meeting place&mdash;the judgment-seat.&nbsp;
Rev. xx. 12.&nbsp; Rom. xiv. 10.</p>
<p class="gutindent">You cannot avoid it.</p>
<p class="gutindent">It will be.</p>

Matt. xxv. 30.&nbsp; Luke, vi. 25.</p>
<p class="gutindent">3.&nbsp; To many a place of rejoicing.&nbsp;
Matt. xxv. 34.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Believing mother!&nbsp; Your night of
weeping will then be over, your morning of joy will dawn, of
which the sun will never set!&nbsp; Ps. xxx. 5.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Which will it be to you&mdash;a

Christ here, that you may both part and meet in peace!</p>

children.&nbsp; They may go with you to the edge of the river,
but no further.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Of weeping.&nbsp; Gen. xxxv. 18; xxiii. 2.&nbsp;
John, xi. 31.&nbsp; 2 Sam. xix. 4.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; It is an hour when Christ, and <i>Christ alone</i>,
can save you.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Thus we pray, &lsquo;In the hour of death,
and in the day of judgment, Good Lord, deliver us.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="gutindent">His rod and staff alone can help you.&nbsp;
Ps. xxiii. 4.</p>
<p class="gutindent">He alone can take away the sting from
death.&nbsp; 1 Cor. xv. 55, 57.&nbsp; Rom. viii. 38, 39.&nbsp;
Isa. xliii. 2.</p>
<p class="gutindent">It is only if washed in His blood, and

<span class="smcap">The Cradle and the Grave</span>.</h2>
<p>God has been speaking to us during the past year.&nbsp; Two
mothers have gone to their long home, and ten of our
children.&nbsp; Let us reply, &lsquo;Speak, Lord, for thy servant
heareth.&rsquo;&nbsp; 1 Sam. iii. 9.</p>
<p>God speaks to us from the cradle, and the grave.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; From the <i>cradle</i>, and says,</p>

it for <i>me</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; Exod. ii. 9.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
